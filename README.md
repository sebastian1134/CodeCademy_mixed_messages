#Mixed Messages

##Project Tasks

1. **Plan your project**
Visualize your end result. What is it built with? What can it do? Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that aren’t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent scope creep.

The following tasks will help you identify natural break points.

2. **Come Up with a Topic**
Decide on what types of messages you want your program to output.

3. **Create script and run it locally**
On your computer, create a JavaScript file to write your code in. Make sure you are able to run your script locally in Node.

4. **Set up version control**
Set up Git tracking in your directory and add and commit changes as you make them.

5. **Store message components**
Decide how to store all of the message components for your game.

6. **Create the message**
Add functionality to randomly select the different message components so they can create a cohesive message.

7. **Put the program together**
Combine the different parts of your program so the random messages are selected, combined, and then displayed to the user each time they run the program.

8. **Next Steps**
You’re welcome to expand your program beyond these project tasks and get creative!
